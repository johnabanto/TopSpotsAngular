This project is utilizing Angular to pull data from a JSON file to populate a table and create buttons to open locations in Google Maps. This is my introduction into Angular and definitely happy with how Angular simplifies my code and I can only imagine how it will streamline my code when there is way more code included. Biggest challenge I had on this project was learning new syntax to use with angular and how it works with HTML and JavaScript.
